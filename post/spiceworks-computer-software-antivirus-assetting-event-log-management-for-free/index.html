      <p>Nearly 7 years ago, at the tender age of 18 I spent about 6 months coding and perfecting a VBScript/WMI software &amp; computer assetting tool for Sysmex UK, the company I was working for at the time.<br>
I was coding it myself because the asset management systems at the time were either incredibly poorly featured, labour intensive, expensive or all three.</p>
<p>I would have given my right arm for something along the lines of <a href="http://www.spiceworks.com" title="Spiceworks - Software and Computer Management">SpiceWorks </a></p>
<p><a href="/images//2011/04/spiceworks.jpg"><img src="/images//2011/04/spiceworks.jpg?w=300" alt="" title="Spiceworks"></a></p>
<p>[](/images//2011/04/spiceworks.jpg)It consists of a web-interface hosted by a discreet Apache server, from which you can configure &amp; view:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network Range</li>
<li>Active Directory Users</li>
<li>Computers</li>
<li>Installed Software</li>
<li>Antivirus Installs &amp; Update Status</li>
<li>Event Logs</li>
</ul>
<p>All of which is absolutely essential in an enterprise business environment; which is why corporations pay tens of thousands for such systems.</p>
<p>But what about the small to medium businesses? Those that need to asset their software and hardware, but who can’t justify thousands of pounds to manage 5-20 computers?<br>
Well, that’s where the best thing about Spiceworks comes  in, it’s <strong>FREE</strong>.<br>
Ideally they need to have an AD environment of some description or else you’ll have to make sure there’s a local account on each computer setup with the same username and password that has WMI rights.</p>
<p>I was rather worried about the security implications at first, but as far as I’ve been able to discover, they’re a very reputable company who seem to take their customer’s privacy very seriously.<br>
In <em>theory</em> it should even comply with ISO27001 as none of the data is hosted off-site, but don’t quote me on it.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point of this post was to draw attentions to some difficulties I had while configuring it initially.</p>
<h1 id="my-initial-configuration-problems">My Initial Configuration Problems</h1>
<h2 id="computers-not-appearing-inventory-after-network-scan">Computers Not Appearing Inventory after Network Scan</h2>
<p>I had this problem initially and quickly discovered it was due to ICMP (ping) being blocked by the client PCs firewalls.<br>
You can change this via group policy by enabling it under the following:</p>
<p><code>Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Network &gt; NetworkConnections &gt; Windows Firewall &gt; Domain Profile</code></p>
<h2 id="active-directory-users-not-importing-empty-people-inventory">Active Directory Users Not Importing (Empty People Inventory)</h2>
<p>This could be caused by a number of things:</p>
<p>Most common apparently seems to be the username you’re entering to query AD with is formatted incorrectly.<br>
It should be <em>username@domain</em>. e.g. <em><a href="mailto:administrator@contoso.com">administrator@contoso.com</a></em></p>
<p>Alternatively it could be that the base DN needs configuring.<br>
In  Spiceworks go to</p>
<p><code> Settings &gt; Active Directory &gt; Pro Settings</code></p>
<p>And configure the Base DN to the OU that the users you want to enumerate are in e.g.</p>
<p><code> OU=Staff,DC=contoso,DC=com</code></p>
<p><strong>In my case</strong> it was that my users <em>didn’t have email addresses</em>.<br>
You can fix this either by manually adding email addresses  through AD itself, or going to Pro Settings in Spiceworks and changing</p>
<p><code>Use principal name for email if blank in Active Directory</code></p>
<p>To ‘true’.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After I’d resolved this initial niggles I fell in love with Spiceworks! Thanks guys!</p>
