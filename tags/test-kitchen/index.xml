      <title>Test Kitchen with a SQL Server Dependency</title>

      <description>I want to be able to test my cookbooks/scripts without having to rely on independent testing infrastructure! I want to be able to do kitchen converge and have all my infrastructure ready to go without any further thought to the dependencies!
This is why I’m such a huge fan of Matt Wrock’s Kitchen-Nodes. It’s a provisioner wrapper around Chef-Zero for Test Kitchen, which allows you to access some of the attributes from other nodes which you’re provisioning in Test Kitchen using Chef Search.</description>

      <description>I remember a little while ago, well… over a couple of years ago now… that I’d just learned about Chef and Vagrant, and was introducing one of my co-workers to the ecosystem (somewhat over-enthusiastically), and wanted to help him perform his immediate deployment task using Chef. That deployment task happened to be to deploy and configure a Remote Desktop Gateway. So we spun up a Windows 2012R2 Vagrant box, use the Windows cookbook to add the appropriate Windows feature, ran it, and bam, brick wall.</description>
