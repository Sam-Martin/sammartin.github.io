      <description>Pagerduty has a pretty kickass reporting feature, but my aim is to create a holistic dashboard for my team&amp;rsquo;s operational work, and to do that I need to have all my data in one place. That one place? Splunk!
I love Splunk, have done ever since seeing a presentation on it years ago, but for a long time it stayed out of reach for mere mortals due to its price point.</description>
