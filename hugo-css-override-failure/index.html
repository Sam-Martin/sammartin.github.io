      <p>I recently swapped my blog from <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.<br>
While I liked the former (being MarkDown based, lightweight and easy to use), I adore Hugo as you can host it for free with GitHub Pages.</p>
<h2 id="automation">Automation</h2>
<p>Whenever I setup a Hugo site I automate the deployment of it with <a href="https://travis-ci.com/">Travis CI</a>. This means that I can deploy updates to my blog just by editing and creating MarkDown files in GitHub, and as soon as they&rsquo;re committed to master the updated, rendered, website will be available in a matter of minutes.</p>
<h2 id="styling">Styling</h2>
<p>I customised the <a href="https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c">m10c</a> theme using an SCSS override. (Which is another thing I love about hugo, how easy it is to style.)</p>
<p>This worked by using the <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/">Hugo template lookup order</a> to override the empty default file <code>assets/css/_extra.scss</code> the theme provides by creating my own file in the same path in my Hugo project. Because project files supersede theme files in Hugo&rsquo;s lookup order, my file takes presedence.</p>
<p>It did exactly what I wanted, which was to make it look as much like my old Ghost theme as possible.

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>However, when I set up the Travis pipeline, instead of giving me the customised style above, it gave me a version of my site in the default styling.

</p>
<p>Weird&hellip;<br>
I went over everything. I checked.</p>
<ol>
<li>The commands Travis was running to generate the files vs what I was running on my laptop</li>
<li>The version of Hugo Travis was running</li>
<li>The version of template Travis was downloading</li>
<li>Whether I&rsquo;d accidentally <code>.gitignored</code> the wrong file</li>
<li>Resetting the theme submodule</li>
<li>Checking out the theme separately not as a submodule</li>
<li>That I&rsquo;d ignored the <code>resources</code> folder in the Hugo project to avoid polluting it</li>
<li>That I cleared the build folder in Travis before doing anything</li>
<li>The SHAsums of all the files on my laptop vs when checked out on Travis</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Everything</em> was identical. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what the issue was, so I uploaded the copy generated on my laptop and left it for a few weeks.</p>
<p>When I came back, I swapped over to using a Docker image both locally and in Travis and it <em>STILL</em> rendered correctly on my laptop and incorrectly in Travis.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>Eventually I discovered that in addition to the <code>resources</code> folder in the Hugo project (which holds a cache of rendered data from the last Hugo run, including CSS) that one got generated in the <em>THEME</em>.</p>
<p>So I cleared that, and re-ran the dockerised Hugo on my laptop.</p>
<pre><code>ERROR 2020/02/04 20:00:10 Transformation failed: TOCSS: failed to transform &quot;css/main.scss&quot; (text/x-scss): this feature is not available in your current Hugo version, see https://goo.gl/YMrWcn for more information
</code></pre><p>Turns out that there&rsquo;s something called Hugo Extended which has the capability to render SCSS (a dynamic CSS templating framework I&rsquo;d never used before because I&rsquo;m a decade out of date with web design).<br>
If you have Hugo Extended, your SCSS files will render and be cached in the <code>resources</code> folders of your project and theme every time you build your site in Hugo.<br>
If you don&rsquo;t have Hugo extended it will throw an error.</p>
<p>Okay, so that explains why it worked on my laptop (which had Hugo Extended) because my laptop rerendered the SCSS into CSS every time.<br>
But why didn&rsquo;t it throw that error on Jenkins/Docker when it couldn&rsquo;t render the SCSS into CSS?</p>
<p>Because as it turns out, the theme creator had (presumably accidentally) checked in the <code>resources</code> folder into Git. That meant that even though the version of Hugo running in Travis couldn&rsquo;t render the CSS (and thereby take into account my styling), it didn&rsquo;t throw an error because the default CSS was cached in the <code>resources</code> folder.</p>
<p>All I had to do was swap Travis to run the <code>-ext</code> Hugo docker image, and <em>voila</em> the site was styled correctly!</p>
<h2 id="travis-build">Travis Build</h2>
<p>The final <code>travis.yml</code> looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>services:
  - docker
before_install:
  - docker pull klakegg/hugo:0.64.0-ext
script:
  - git clone https://github.com/Sam-Martin/hugo-theme-m10c.git themes/m10c
  - |
    docker run --rm -it \
    -v $(pwd):/src \
    -v $(pwd)/output:/target \
    klakegg/hugo:0.64.0-ext
deploy:
  provider: pages
  local_dir: output
  github_token: &quot;$GITHUB_TOKEN&quot;
  verbose: true
  skip_cleanup: true
  repo: Sam-Martin/sammartin.github.io
  fqdn: sammart.in
  target_branch: master
</code></pre><p>Super simple, and all it needed was <code>klakegg/hugo:0.64.0-ext</code> instead of <code>klakegg/hugo:0.64.0</code>.</p>
<p>Remember kids, error messages are a gift. When you get one, it is 1000x easier to figure out what&rsquo;s going on than if it errors without a message, or (as was the case here) it proceeds with insane behaviour.</p>
