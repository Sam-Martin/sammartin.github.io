      <description>As I mentioned in a previous post, AWS Config is an excellent tool for ensuring compliance across your AWS accounts, but can be challenging to set up consistently across large numbers of regions and accounts. To ease this pain I attempted to set up AWS Config using CloudFormation but found this challenging when using custom rules due to the necessity of uploading the Lambda functions to an S3 bucket in each region first.</description>

      <title>Combating Passwords in Emails</title>

      <description>Security is a thorny subject. One I stay away from making sweeping statements or recommendations about whenever possible. However, I’m willing to venture one assertion.
 Plaintext passwords in emails are a BAD IDEA
 Especially when they are the primary method of communicating an initial password to a user.
Who would do that though? All sensible user management system allow the user to set the password themselves, or at worst send out a one-time password reset link.</description>
