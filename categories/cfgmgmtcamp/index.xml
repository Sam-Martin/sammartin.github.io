      <description>At the beginning of February I was lucky enough to attend Configuration Management Camp for the 3rd year running. The first year I attended (2013) it was my first introduction to the concept of configuration management, and god damn it was overwhelming. So many new concepts, new tools, new ideas, I left having been enlightened to a whole new world of automation.
This year, having massively improved my knowledge of modern tools and practices around automation and infrastructure, and now having worked with Chef for a couple of years, I came to cfgmgmtcamp with the goal of learning more about Docker in production.</description>
